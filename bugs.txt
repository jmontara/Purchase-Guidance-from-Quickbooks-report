list of bugs/caveats 

Issue: roPointTarget includes cycle stock.  This is appropriate if the reorder points
are used within Quickbooks, wherin inventory counts are decremented when an item is 
logically built.  The file output "purchaseguidance.txt", decrements inventory counts
based on quickbooks sales orders, however, and so such reorder points would be 
and in fact appear to be overly conservative. 
Plan:  remove cycle stock from the inventory reorder point calculation.



Issue: itemstats includes target reorder points equal to zero.
